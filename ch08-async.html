<h1>Asynchronous processing</h1>

<!--
for learning, i'd start with atom, since it is really just atom, deref/@, swap!, and reset! in a nutshell
-->

<p>
In this chapter, you will write an étude that uses <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core.async"><em>core.async</em></a> to do asynchronous processing.
</p>
  
<p>
Here are two examples of using <em>core.async</em>. In the first example, Amy and Brian are going to send each other the numbers 5 down to zero, stopping at zero, in a project named <code>async1</code>. You will need to add some <code>:require</code> and <code>:require-macro</code> specifications to your namespace:
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(ns ^:figwheel-always async1.core
  (:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go go-loop]])
    (:require [cljs.core.async
               :refer [&lt;! &gt;! timeout alts! chan close!]]))</pre>

<p>
Then, define a <em>channel</em> for both Amy and Brian:
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(def amy (chan))
(def brian (chan))</pre>

<p>
Amy gets two processes: one for sending messages to Brian and another for receiving messages from him.
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn amy-send []
  (go (loop [n 5]
           (println "Amy sends" n "to Brian")
           (&gt;! brian n)
           (if (&gt; n 0) (recur (dec n)) nil))))

(defn amy-receive []
  (go-loop [_ nil]
           (let [reply (&lt;! brian)]
             (println "Amy receives" reply "from Brian")
             (if (&gt; reply 0) (recur nil) (close! amy)))))</pre>

<p>
In the <code>amy-send</code> function, you see the <code>go</code> function, which asynchronously executes its body and immediately returns to the calling function. The <code>&gt;!</code> function sends data to a channel. The loop continues until <code>n</code> equals zero, at which point the function returns <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p>
Because <code>go</code> and <code>loop</code> occur together so often, ClojureScript has the <code>go-loop</code> construct, which you see in the <code>amy-receive</code> function. That function loops (but does not need the loop variable) until it has received the zero, at which point it performs a <code>close!</code> on the channel.
</p>

<p>
A similar pair of functions <code>brian-send</code> and <code>brian-receive</code> do Brian’s sending and receiving tasks (they are not shown here).
</p>

<p>
All that remains to be done is write a function that invokes these processes:
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn async-test []
  (do
    (println "Starting...")
    (amy-send)
    (amy-receive)
    (brian-send)
    (brian-receive)))</pre>

<p>
Here is the console log output from invoking <code>async-test</code>. You can see that this is indeed asynchronous; the sends and receives are in no particular order.
</p>

<pre>
Amy sends 5 to Brian
Amy receives 5 from Brian
Brian sends 5 to Amy
Brian receives 5 from Amy
Amy sends 4 to Brian
Amy sends 3 to Brian
Brian sends 4 to Amy
Brian sends 3 to Amy
Amy receives 4 from Brian
Amy receives 3 from Brian
Brian receives 4 from Amy
Brian receives 3 from Amy
Amy sends 2 to Brian
Amy sends 1 to Brian
Brian sends 2 to Amy
Brian sends 1 to Amy
Amy receives 2 from Brian
Amy receives 1 from Brian
Brian receives 2 from Amy
Brian receives 1 from Amy
Amy sends 0 to Brian
Brian sends 0 to Amy
Amy receives 0 from Brian
Brian receives 0 from Amy</pre>

<p>
You can see the entire program here: <a href="#SOLUTION08-ET00A" data-type="xref">#SOLUTION08-ET00A</a>.
</p>

<p>
The next example using <em>core.async</em>, in a project named <code>async2</code>, has processes that communicate with one another in a semi-synchronized manner. In this case, Amy will start off by sending Brian the number 8; he will send her a 7; she sends back 6, and so on, down to zero.
</p>

<p>
In this case, both people do the same thing: send the next lower number to their partner, then await the partner’s reply. Here is the function to activate the process for the two partners. The <code>from-str</code> and <code>to-str</code> parameters are used for the debug output. 
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn activate [[from-str from-chan] [to-str to-chan] start-value]
  (go-loop [n start-value]
           (if (&gt;= n 0)
             (do
               (println from-str "sends" n "to" to-str)
               (&gt;! to-chan n))
             nil)
           (let [reply (&lt;! from-chan)]
             (println from-str "gets" reply)
             (if (&gt;= reply 0) (recur (dec reply))
                             (do
                               (close! from-chan)
                               (close! to-chan)
                               (println "Finished"))))))</pre>

<p>
The first <code>if</code> expression will take care of the asymmetry in the processes; Amy starts the sending, and Brian starts by receiving her data.
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn async-test []
  (let [amy (chan)
        brian (chan)]
    (activate ["Amy" amy] ["Brian" brian] 8)
    (activate ["Brian" brian] ["Amy" amy] -1)))</pre>

<p>
Here is the output from invoking <code>async-test</code>.
</p>

<pre>Amy sends 8 to Brian
Brian gets 8
Brian sends 7 to Amy
Amy gets 7
Amy sends 6 to Brian
Brian gets 6
Brian sends 5 to Amy
Amy gets 5
Amy sends 4 to Brian
Brian gets 4
Brian sends 3 to Amy
Amy gets 3
Amy sends 2 to Brian
Brian gets 2
Brian sends 1 to Amy
Amy gets 1
Amy sends 0 to Brian
Brian gets 0</pre>

[[PROCESSES]]
== Processes


NOTE: You can learn more about working with simple processes in Chapter 4 of _Erlang Programming_, Chapter 8 of _Programming Erlang_, Section 2.13 of _Erlang and OTP in Action_, and Chapters 10 and 11 of _Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good!_.

[[CH08-ET01]]
Étude 8-1: Using Processes to Simulate a Card Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is only one étude for this chapter. You're going to
write an Erlang program that lets the computer play the card
game of "War" against itself.

The Art of War
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the rules of the game as condensed from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29[Wikipedia], adapted
to two players, and simplified further.

Two players each take 26 cards from a shuffled deck. Each person
puts her top card face up on the table. Whoever has the higher
value card wins that battle, takes both cards, and puts
them at the bottom of her stack. What happens the if the cards 
have the same value?
Then the players go to "war." Each person puts the next two cards from
their stack face down in the pile and a third card face up. High card
wins, and the winner takes all the cards for the bottom of her stack.
If the cards match again, the war continues with another set of three cards from
each person. If a person has fewer than three cards
when a war happens, he puts in all his cards.

Repeat this entire procedure until one person has all the cards. That player
wins the game. In this game, aces are considered to have the highest value,
and King > Queen > Jack.

War: What is it good for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Absolutely nothing. Well, almost nothing. War is possibly the most
incredibly inane card game ever invented. It is a great way for children
to spend time, and it's perfect as an étude because

* it is naturally implementable as processes (players) passing messages
(cards)
* there is no strategy involved in the play, thus allowing you to concentrate
on the processes and messages

Pay Now or Pay Later
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you purchase an item, if you pay cash on the spot, you often end up paying
less than if you used credit. If you are cooking a meal, getting all of the
ingredients collected before you start (pay now) is often less stressful than
having to stop and go to the grocery store for items you found out you didn't
have (pay later). In most cases, "pay now" ends up being less expensive than
"pay later," and that certainly applies to most programming tasks.

So, before you rush off to start writing code, let me give you a word of advice:
Don't. Spend some time with paper and pencil, away from the computer, and
_design_ this program first. This is a non-trivial program, and the "extra"
time you spend planning it (pay now) will save you a lot of time in
debugging and rewriting (pay later). As someone once told me, "Hours of
programming will save you minutes of planning."

Trust me, programs written at the keyboard look like it, and that
is not meant as a compliment.

Note: This does not mean that you should never use +erl+ or write anything
at the keyboard. If you are wondering about how a specific part of Erlang
works and need to write a small test program to find out, go ahead and do that
right away.

Hint: Do your design on paper. Don't try to keep the whole thing in your
head. Draw diagrams. Sometimes a picture or a storyboard of how the
messages should flow will clarify your thinking. (If your parents ever
asked you, "Do I have to draw you a diagram?", you may now confidently
answer "Yes. Please do that. It really helps.")

The Design
^^^^^^^^^^
When I first started planning this, I was going to have just two processes
communicating with one another, as it is in a real game. But let's think
about that. There is a slight asymmetry between the players. One
person usually brings the cards and suggests playing the game. He shuffles
the deck and deals out the cards at the beginning. Once that's done, 
things even out. The game play itself proceeds almost automatically. Neither
player is in control of the play, yet both of them are. It seems as if
there is an implicit, almost telepathic communication between the players.
Actually, there are no profound metaphysical issues here. Both players
are simultaneously following the same set of rules. And that's the point that
bothered me: who makes the "decisions" in the program? I decided to sidestep
the issue by introducing a third agent, the "dealer," who is responsible for
giving the cards to each player at the start of the game. The dealer then
can tell each player to turn over cards, make a decision as to who won, and
then tell a particular player to take cards. This simplifies the message
flow considerably and also fits in nicely with the OTP concepts of supervisors
and servers, covered in Chapter 10 of
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do[Introducing Erlang].


In my code, the dealer had to keep track of:

* The process IDs of the players (this was a list)
* The current state of play (see the following)
* Cards received from player 1 for this battle
* Cards received from player 2 for this battle
* The number of players who had given the dealer cards so far (0, 1, or 2)
* The pile of cards in the middle of the table

The dealer spawns the players, and then is in one of the following states.
I'm going to anthropomorphize and use "me" to represent the dealer.

Pre-battle::
  Tell the players to send me cards. If the pile is empty, then
  it's a normal battle; give me one card each. If the pile isn't empty, then
  it's a war; give me three cards.
  
Await battle::
  Wait to receive the cards from the players. Add one to the count every
  time I get a player's cards. When the count reaches two, I'm ready for...

Check Cards::
  If either player has sent me an empty list for their cards, then that player
  is out of cards, so the other player must be the winner.
+
If I really have cards from both players, compare them. If one player
is a winner, give that player the pile plus the cards currently in play.
If the cards match, add the cards currently in play to the pile, and
go back to "Pre-battle" state.

Note that this is my implementation; you may find an entirely
different and better way to write the program.

Messages Are Asynchronous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Remember that the order in which a process receives messages may
not be the same order in which they were sent. For example, if players
Andrea and Bertram have a battle, and Andrea wins,
you may be tempted to send these messages:

1. Tell Andrea to pick up the two cards that were in the battle.
2. Tell Andrea to send you a card for the next battle.
3. Tell Bertram to send you a card for the next battle.

This works nicely unless Andrea had just thrown her last card down
for that battle and message two arrives _before_ message one.
Andrea will report that she is out of cards, thus losing the game,
even though she's really still in the game with the two cards that
she hasn't picked up yet.

Hints for Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Modify the +cards+ module that you wrote in <<CH07-ET06,Étude 7-6>>
to generate a small deck with, say, only
four cards in two suits. If you try to play with a full deck, the game could
go on for a very, very long time.

Use plenty of calls to +io:format/2+ to see what your code is really doing.
